'''Part of the Dibujos Hiperb√≥licos program.

We define a generator surfacegroup(n) for the ball of radius n of the
Fuchsian group representing the fundamental group of a surface of genus g 
with respect to genrators t_1,...,t_{4*genus} satifying the standard 
commutation relations [t_1,t_2][t_4,t_5]... = 1.

We use Dehn's algorithm to generate each element only once (see wikipedia page).
